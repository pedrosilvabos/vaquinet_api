PORT=10000


Running the API
---------------

Locally:
--------
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the correct Supabase keys
4. Start the server:

   node index.js

On Render:
----------
- Set environment variables via the Render dashboard.
- Make sure your `package.json` includes:
  {
    "type": "module"
  }


Notes
-----
- Supabase table name must be exactly `cows`.
- Ensure that the table is marked as publicly readable via Supabase RLS or security policies.
- This is a read-only API for now; POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints can be added later.
